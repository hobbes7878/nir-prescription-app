<h3>GP Deprivation Groups</h3>

<p>One major goal of the analysis was to determine what effect economic circumstances had on antidepressant prescription rates. To measure the relationship, first some gauge of economics had to be assessed at the level of individual GPs. Official statisical indexes of deprivation at the smallest geographic census level were used.


<img id="deprive_chart" src="{% static 'rx/image/GP_Deprivation_Distribution.png' %}">

<p>The above probability density chart shows what ratio of GPs are in each of four deprivation groups in Northern Ireland, England and Wales. The deprivation groups range from least deprived to most deprived and were calculated by taking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" target="_blank">Z-score</a> — a statistical measure that allows for comparison of the scores between countries — for each GP’s local deprivation level. 

<p>In Northern Ireland and Wales, The Detail assigned deprivation scores to each GP based on the scores for income and employment levels in the area of each GP’s postcode. In England, GPs are assessed deprivation scores and these were used.

<p>Break points for the overall deprivation groups were determined by averaging the quartiles for the three countries.

<p>The distribution shows that a greater proportion of English GPs lie in areas that would be considered least deprived, compared to Northern Ireland and Wales. To better account for that difference, the analysis compares prescription rates of each country’s GPs within their respective deprivation group.


<h3>Deprivation Influence</h3>

<img id="deprive_ddd_charts" src="{% static 'rx/image/Deprivation_DDD_Charts.png' %}">
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficients for GP deprivation scores and daily doses prescribed per head were .44 for Northern Ireland; .31, Wales; .22, England, all of which were significant at p < .001 .

<p>A few influential outliers were identified via Cook’s Distance for both Northern Ireland and England. Excluding four outlying data points did not significantly improve the correlation coefficient for England. Northern Ireland’s coefficient improved to .48 after excluding two influential outliers.

<p>The differences between correlation coefficients were tested for statistical significance using the Fisher transformation. Northern Ireland’s correlation coefficient was significantly greater than Wales’ and England’s at p < .05 and p < .001, respectively.
