<h1>The Script Report</h1>

<p class="margin">Happy pills, benzos, tranqs, cotton, mother's little helper, dreamy-sleepy-nightie-snoozy-snooze. For every pill in the growing variety of modern psychotropic medication, a pet name. Some a product of abuse; others, fondness.

<p class="margin">According to the most recent 10 years of data available from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, antidepressants are directly responsible for the deaths of about 21 people in Northern Ireland each year.

<p class="margin">Benzodiazepines, a class of drugs commonly featured among anti-anxiety medicines, were responsible for the deaths of 290 people between 2003 and 2012.

<p class="margin">Powerful opiates and sedatives carry a high risk of developing dependence, are often fatal in overdose and are sometimes a gateway to dangerous illegal drugs.

<p class="margin"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/nov/20/mental-health-antidepressants-global-trends" target="_blank">Recent international studies</a> have cited stark upward trends in prescription drug consumption, especially of chemicals that act on the central nervous system including antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, sleep aids and opioid painkillers. Some of these medications carry significant risks of addiction alongside potentially severe side-effects up to fatal overdose. Street-level trade of prescription pills has also increased while <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25058728" target="_blank">pharmaceutical supply chains have become wholesale targets of thieves</a> looking to meet demand for the hottest new street drugs.

<p class="margin">The Script Report uses general practitioner prescribing data recently made available to contextualize just how many of these types of drugs are regularly prescribed and consumed in Northern Ireland. Data available in other parts of the UK — England and Wales — also make it possible to form a basis for comparison within broadly similar health care systems.

<p class="margin">Monthly prescribing data for Northern Irish GPs are now released quarterly. With data already available for April though September 2013, The Detail looked at drugs in four categories of medication: antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, sedatives and opioid painkillers.

<p class="margin">In all four categories, Northern Ireland outpaced other UK countries in its per person rate of drug consumption. The Detail also compared prescription rates within the level of economic disadvantage a GP's local community faces.

<p class="margin">You can use this site to explore facts and statistics for individual drugs as well as overall prescribing trends at GPs across Northern Ireland, but first...

<tr>
<td class="instruct_td_head">Defined Daily Dose</td>
<td class="instruct_td_text">
	<p>Per the World Health Organization:
	<blockquote cite="http://www.whocc.no/ddd/definition_and_general_considera/">
		<p>The Defined Daily Dose is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults.</p>
	</blockquote> 

	<p>The Detail used the Defined Daily Dose (or just "daily dose") to make different drugs prescribed at different strengths comparable. For example, diazepam has a Defined Daily Dose of 10mg. So 10 diazepam pills at the 10mg dosage are evaluated the same as 5 pills at 20mg: 10 daily doses. 
	<p>The daily dose is a statistical average and not a prescribing guide. Doctors prescribe different daily regimens based on individual patients and their particular conditions.

	<p>The groups range:
	<ul>
	<li>LEAST deprived GPs are in wealthier areas</li>

<h2>Antidepressants</h2>
<p class="margin">Northern Irish patients consume more antidepressants than all other categories of prescription medication in our study combined – almost 7.5 million daily doses per month. In the six months of prescribing data that The Detail analysed, GPs prescribed enough antidepressant drugs to give every man, woman, and child in the country a 27-day supply at the Defined Daily Dosage limits. By comparison, English GPs prescribed enough in six months for 10 daily doses per registered patient. Wales doled out 19.

	<h4>International Antidepressant Consumption</h4>
	<div class="center_limit">
	<p><a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201311/the-oecd-warns-antidepressant-overprescribing">In a widely publicized report</a> last November, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development compared international antidepressant prescribing rates among 23 member countries, mostly European. The report cited the number of defined daily doses per 1,000 people per day, which is a measure designed to approximate the number of patients regularly using a medication per thousand.

	<p>In the report, the United Kingdom ranked 7th highest among OECD member nations at 71 daily doses per thousand people per day. Topping the list was Iceland at 106 daily doses per thousand per day.

	<div id="minimaps_svg"></div>
		<div class="center_limit">
	<p>The Detail’s analysis indicates, if Northern Ireland were considered apart from the rest of UK, it would take the top spot internationally in the OECD report at 129 daily doses per thousand per day. Wales would lag behind at 105.5.</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>

<p class="margin">But why are antidepressants prescribed in Northern Ireland so much more often or in such larger quantities? 

<p class="margin">Using the prevalence of suicide as an approximation, severe mental health problems may be more endemic in Northern Ireland than in other parts of the UK.

<p class="margin">According to the most recent data available for five years, 2007-2011, Northern Ireland averaged more than 15 suicides for every 100,000 people. That rate is 89 percent higher than the English average (just over 8 per 100,000) and 64 percent higher than the Welsh (about 9.5). 

<p class="margin">The difference in Northern Irish antidepressant prescription rates, by way of comparison, is 140 percent higher than the English rate but only 22 percent higher than the Welsh. 

<p class="margin">Those figures might suggest there is a significantly greater number of people suffering mental health problems in Northern Ireland and therefore higher prescription rates may just be keeping up with the greater need. But a one-to-one comparison of suicide rates to prescription rates may be misleading, since suicides represent such a small number compared to those taking antidepressants.

<p class="margin">Depression prevalence statistics reported by GPs as part of the <a href="http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/statistics_and_research-qof-prevalence" target="_blank">Quality and Outcomes Framework</a> are a better indication of depression rates in the general population. Northern Ireland ranks middle of the pack in the UK, with an average of about 5.1 percent of a GP’s registered patients who have been diagnosed with depression at some point in their lifetime. England ranks highest at about 7.5 percent of patients having been clinically depressed. Wales reports just over 4 percent. 

<p class="margin">All GPs don’t necessarily recognize symptoms of depression the same, still the statistics indicate England ranks highest in the rate of depression diagnosis and yet prescribes significantly fewer antidepressants per patient than Northern Ireland and Wales.

<h4>Depressed/Deprived</h4>

<p class="margin">As part of the GP prescribing data analysis, The Detail tested whether economic hardship was at all related to antidepressant prescription rates, which might help explain the difference in Northern Irish rates.

<p class="margin">Local economic circumstances are measured in all UK countries by measures known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_deprivation_index" target="_blank">indices of deprivation</a>, which score local areas according to income and employment levels. The Detail used these indices to statistically test the relationship between the economic deprivation in a GP’s local community and its antidepressant prescription rate.

<p class="margin">According to the analysis, deprivation scores are only weakly correlated with the number of antidepressant daily doses a GP prescribes per registered patient.

<p class="margin">Across the three countries studied, the relationship between deprivation and antidepressant prescription rates is significantly stronger in Northern Ireland than in both England and Wales. But even in Northern Ireland the relationship is too weak to reliably indicate a relationship. In statistical terms, the level of deprivation only explains about 23 percent of the variability in the number of antidepressant daily doses prescribed. A reliable correlation should probably explain north of 50 percent.

<p class="margin">Based on the analysis, it would be problematic to say economic deprivation drives the high prescription rate of antidepressants in Northern Ireland.

<p class="margin">In fact, the difference between each country's antidepressant prescription rate was actually greatest among GPs in least deprived areas. Northern Ireland consumed more than two and a half times the antidepressants per head than GPs in similarly wealthy economic areas in England. Wales was consistently closer to Northern Irish prescription rates, but still averaged over 25 percent fewer doses consumed per head across all deprivation groups.

<h4>Chicken-and-Egg</h4>

<p class="margin">One relationship that has been well-established by research is that between depression and diabetes.

<p class="margin">Estimates are that one in every three diabetes patients exhibits elevated symptoms of depression if not a clinical diagnosis. But it’s difficult to say definitively one condition causes the other.

<p class="margin">Research by German diabetes research group, Forschungsinstitut der Diabetes-Akademie Mergentheim, has called the relationship between depression and diabetes a “chicken and egg” problem.

<p class="margin">Their <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11428-010-0678-4" target="_blank">research</a> found the presence of depression symptoms in a patient increases the likelihood of developing diabetes by 37 percent. Vice versa, patients diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes were 24 percent more likely to later exhibit symptoms of depression or have a clinical depressive disorder.


<p class="margin">In the UK, Northern Ireland has the lowest rate of diabetes diagnoses, about 4 percent of the population according to <a href='https://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/What-we-say/Statistics/Diabetes-prevalence-2012/' target="_blank">the most recent prevalence statistics</a>. Again, England has the highest rate at 5.8 percent, slightly over 2.5 million people.

<h2 style='clear:left;'>Anti-anxiety Drugs</h2>
<p>According to prescribing data, about 800,000 daily doses of anti-anxiety drugs are consumed by Northern Irish patients each month.

<p>GPs in least deprived areas of Northern Ireland tend to prescribe slightly larger amounts of anti-anxiety drugs – 2.25 daily doses per head in least deprived areas up to 2.75 in most deprived. 

<p>Again, Northern Ireland out-prescribes England and Wales by the widest margins among GPs in least deprived areas — over five and a half times the rate in England and almost twice the rate in Wales.

<h2 style='clear:left;'>Opioid Painkillers and Sedatives</h2>

<p>Opioids include very strong painkillers like morphine and oxycodone. They are often used in palliative care for pain relief in patients with serious illness. They are normally prescribed under close supervision and can carry a high risk of dependence with severe side-effects, especially on overdose. Sedatives are also habit-forming medications. Both types of drugs are regularly abused and traded on the black market.

<p>About 850,000 daily doses of opioid analgesics are consumed by Northern Irish patients each month. Approximately 1.4 million daily doses of sedatives are consumed monthly.

<p>The differences between Northern Irish and other UK country prescription rates did not show as clear a trend for opioid painkillers and sedatives as those for antidepressants and anti-anxiety medicines.

<p>Opioid analgesics are prescribed in slightly greater quantities among GPs in most deprived areas. Sedatives showed no clear trend between prescription rates and deprivation.
