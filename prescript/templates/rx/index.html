<h1>The Script Report</h1>

<p>Happy pills, benzos, tranqs, cotton, mother's little helper, dreamy-sleepy-nightie-snoozy-snooze. For every pill in the growing variety of modern psychotropic medication, a pet name. Some a product of abuse; others, fondness.

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/nov/20/mental-health-antidepressants-global-trends" target="_blank">Recent international studies</a> have cited stark upward trends in prescription drug consumption, especially of chemicals that act on the central nervous system including antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, sleep aids and opioid painkillers. Some of these medications carry significant risks of addiction alongside potentially severe side-effects up to fatal overdose. Street-level trade of prescription pills has also increased while <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25058728" target="_blank">pharmaceutical supply chains have become wholesale targets of dealers</a>.

<p>The Script Report uses general practitioner prescribing data recently made available to contextualize just how many of these types of drugs are regularly prescribed and consumed in Northern Ireland. Data available in other parts of the UK — England and Wales — also make it possible to form a basis for comparison within broadly similar health care systems.

<p>Monthly prescribing data for Northern Irish GPs are now released quarterly. With data already available for April though September 2013, The Detail looked at drugs in four categories of medication: antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, sedatives and opioid painkillers.

<p>In all four categories, Northern Ireland outpaced other UK countries in its per person rate of drug consumption. The Detail also compared prescription rates within the level of economic disadvantage a GP's local community faces.

<p>You can use this site to explore facts and statistics for individual drugs as well as overall prescribing trends at GPs across Northern Ireland, but first...

<h3>Two important concepts to understand</h3>

<table id="instruct_table">
<colgroup>
	<col width="300px">
	<col>
</colgroup>

<tr>
<td class="instruct_td_head">Defined Daily Dose</td>
<td class="instruct_td_text">
	<p>Per the World Health Organization:
	<blockquote cite="http://www.whocc.no/ddd/definition_and_general_considera/">
		<p>The Defined Daily Dose is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults.</p>
	</blockquote> 

	<p>The Detail used the Defined Daily Dose (or just "daily dose") to make different drugs prescribed at different strengths comparable. For example, diazepam has a Defined Daily Dose of 10mg. So 10 diazepam pills at the 10mg dosage are evaluated the same as 5 pills at 20mg: 10 daily doses. 
	<p>The daily dose is a statistical average and not a prescribing guide. Doctors prescribe different daily regimens based on individual patients and their particular conditions.

<tr>
<td class="instruct_td_head">Deprivation</td>
<td class="instruct_td_text">
	<p>National statistics agencies in the UK estimate the level of economic hardship in a community using statistical measures known as indexes of deprivation. The poorer the economic opportunities in an area, the more deprived it's said to be.
	<p>The Detail grouped GPs into four categories based on the level of deprivation in their local community to make the most exacting comparisons possible of their prescription rates.
	<p>The groups range:
	<ul>
	<li>LEAST deprived GPs are in wealthier areas</li>
	<li>LESS deprived</li>
	<li>MORE deprived</li>
	<li>MOST deprived GPs are in some of the poorest areas</li>

<h2>Antidepressants</h2>
<p>Northern Irish patients consume more antidepressants than all other categories of prescription medication in our study combined – almost 7.5 million daily doses per month. In the six months The Detail studied, GPs prescribed enough of the drugs to give every man, woman, and child in the country a 27-day supply at the Defined Daily Dosage limits. By comparison, English GPs prescribed enough for 10 daily doses per registered patient. Wales doled out 19. 

<p>The difference between each country's antidepressant prescription rate was actually greatest among GPs in least deprived areas. Northern Ireland consumed more than two and a half times the antidepressants than GPs in similar economic areas in England, per head. Wales was consistently closer to Northern Irish prescription rates, but still averaged over 25 percent fewer doses consumed per head across all deprivation groups.

<p>GPs in least deprived areas of Northern Ireland tend to prescribe larger amounts of anti-anxiety drugs – 21 daily doses per patient in least deprived areas up to about 28 in most deprived. 

<p>According to the most recent data available for 10 years, antidepressants are directly responsible for the deaths of about 21 people in Northern Ireland each year.

	<h4>International Antidepressant Consumption</h4>
	<div class="center_limit">
	<p><a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201311/the-oecd-warns-antidepressant-overprescribing">In a widely publicized report</a> last November, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development compared international antidepressant prescribing rates. The report cited the number of defined daily doses per 1,000 people per day, which is a measure designed to approximate the number of patients regularly using a medication per thousand.

	<p>In the report, the United Kingdom ranked 7th highest among OECD member nations at 71 daily doses per thousand people per day. Topping the list was Iceland at 106 daily doses per thousand per day.

	</div>
	<div id="minimaps_svg"></div>
		<div class="center_limit">
	<p>The Detail’s analysis indicates, if Northern Ireland were considered apart from the rest of UK, it would take the top spot internationally in the OECD report at 129 daily doses per thousand per day. Wales would lag behind at 105.5.</p>

<h2 style='clear:left;'>Anti-anxiety Drugs</h2>
<p>According to prescribing data, about 800,000 daily doses of anti-anxiety drugs are consumed by Northern Irish patients each month.

<p>GPs in least deprived areas of Northern Ireland tend to prescribe slightly larger amounts of anti-anxiety drugs – 2.25 daily doses per head in least deprived areas up to 2.75 in most deprived. 

<p>Again, Northern Ireland out-prescribes England and Wales by the widest margins among GPs in least deprived areas — over five and a half times the rate in England and almost twice the rate in Wales.

<p>Benzodiazepines, a class of drugs commonly featured among anti-anxiety medicines, were found responsible for the deaths of 290 people between 2003 and 2012.

<h2 style='clear:left;'>Opioid Painkillers and Sedatives</h2>

<p>Opioids include very strong painkillers like morphine and oxycodone. They are often used in palliative care for pain relief in patients with serious illness. They are normally prescribed under close supervision and can carry a high risk of dependence with severe side-effects, especially on overdose. Sedatives are also habit-forming medications. Both types of drugs are regularly abused and traded on the black market.

<p>About 850,000 daily doses of opioid analgesics are consumed by Northern Irish patients each month. Approximately 1.4 million daily doses of sedatives are consumed monthly.

<p>The differences between Northern Irish and other UK country prescription rates did not show as clear a trend for opioid painkillers and sedatives as those for antidepressants and anti-anxiety medicines.

<p>Opioid analgesics are prescribed in slightly greater quantities among GPs in most deprived areas. Sedatives showed no clear trend between prescription rates and deprivation.
